## Component

Alpine js components code is separated and inside 'assets/html/components'. You can rename function inside components html from 'window.functionName = function() {code . . .}' to 'functionName() {code . . .}' if you using different approach for getting component instead of fetching it, this approach is only used for full frontend demonstration purposes. Component code is separated to isolate not essential information and increase readability.
